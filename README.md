# DH110 Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
####_Valentin Nguyen | Spring 2021 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

My current project, _GenMeet_ (name is still tentative), seeks to bridge the gap between people of starkly different generations. The target community are people that are curious to meet other people during the pandemic, socialize within their place of residency, and like spending time with others. These people are looking to socialize and meet other people from different generations to get to know their culture and personalities from the comfort of their own home. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common limitations of chatting online:

1. **User Verification Check** - ensures that users go through a thorough virtual background check to establish a strong sense of safety between users
2. **Help Page** - provides a list of commonly asked questions in regards to the legitimacy of the app as well as how to navigate it.
3. **Overall Trustworthy & Aesthetic Design:** - creates a sense of safety for users when they use the app so that they know the chatting service is meant for serious, productive, and purposeful intentions rather than less serious intentions

**User Personas:** The main target users would specifically be milennials and baby boomers, but can also cater towards other generations as well. Users value ease of use as well as a desktop chatting user experience rather than a mobile chatting user experience. User personas were created based on older generations (Generation x and older) looking to find an easy and accessible way to meet others using technology: one introverted, adults librarian who wants to learn how to talk to people easily and casually, and one retired real estate agent who is interested in how younger people use social media, but does not know how to use it himself and seeks to find out.

**Purpose:** The puropse of this low-fidelty prototype is to test the functionality and flow of the features listed above, and to see how well it can be integrated into the current process of meeting other people. This will test whether the features I have designed work for people realistically, while also observing and inquiring them about the app and its features. The test will give me an opportunity to find solutions to making certain features better and more accessible through listening to their suggestions.

## Tasks

The low-fidelity prototype is for the user to create their own profile. The prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Search field for user to input information about themselves
2. Selecting the 'Next' button to proceed to the next screen
3. Selecting the 'Back' button to go back to the previous screen
4. Selecting which generation the user belongs in, and which they are interested in meeting

#### Notes From Testing:
- On the 4th screen, the user was not sure how to answer the question "Where are you from?" since they interpreted the question in multiple ways. They weren't sure if they should say where they were born, where they were raised, or what their background (ethnicity) is. I asked the participant how they would phrase the question if it was supposed to get information on the user's background, and they suggested more specific questions such as "What is your ethnicity?" with a dropdown menu with options, or "Where were you raised?" The question that asks more directly for the user's ethnicity was something that the particpant would consider with caution because people might have multiple ethnicities, and might leave the user confused or unsure how to answer that question.
- When the participant got to the 5th screen where they had to select which generation they were from, they thought the layout of the generations could have been formatted more cleanly. The participant suggested aligning the boxes in a straight line to make it look more simple, which I might agree with and will consider when making the final wireframes.
- On the 6th screen, I intended for them to select only one generation that they were interested in meeting more people from, but they selected two instead. I think I would like to make it more explicit that users can select multiple generations they are interested in talking with.

## Reflection
Overall, I thought the testing process was pretty successful. Because the prototype displayed a fairly simple task, my participant was able to go through it was a breeze. However, there are still a few features that could still be reflective upon some more.

#### What went smoothly:
- The participant managed to complete the tasks quite efficiently. They also complimented the overall design of the wireflow, which I know isn't the most important thing when illustrating it, but it was still a nice comment that validated one feature I was concerned about -- the visual aesthetic design of the app.
- The participant also provided good suggestions for how to make the app better, both in functionality as well as visual design. They also offered some promising ideas on how to clearify certain questions and how to phrase them better.

#### What went differently than expected:
1. About halfway through the test, the participant asked me a question that I think I had in mind but forgot to consider it when making the wireflow: what about sexual predators that might go into the app, and how will the app ensure safety among its users? I had briefly thought about this and intentionally put a screen at the end stating that the team behind the app will review all profiles to make sure they are legitimate, but that might not be enough to verify the realness of a user. However, this may prove to be inconvenient and inaccessible to some people who may be impatient or do not want to go through the extra step of providing proof or documents of their legitimacy.
2. When the user was selecting which generation they were from, they noticed I had included "Generation Alpha" in the timeline of generations and asked me if younger people would also use this app. I decied to add a Geeeration Alpha option to be more inclusive of the users using the app regardless of age, but I think morally I would not want younger users using the app, especially since my target audiences are milennials and baby boomers.

#### What I would change (based on the things that went differently then expected):
1. To ensure the safety of all users, I would add a feature that asks the user to provide some kind of identification or proof that they are a citizen or a person part of a verified community (school identification cards, credit cards, driver's license, et cetera). This may become a hassle for those that are not patient with technology and do not feel comfortable sharing their identification with the app. An alternative to this would be to ask users to provide additional links to other social media, or more photos of them. I may have to sit on this more, but those are my thoughts at the moment.
2. When the user begins to make a profile, I would want to display a brief list of terms and agreement, with emphasis that this app should not be used by users under a certain age -- I am thinking younger people below the age of 16 or 18 should not use this app for their own safety, even though the purpose of the app if to bridge the gap between people of different generations from each other. With that being said, I would also remove the "Generation Alpha" option off the timeline in screens 5 and 6, since the age range of people using the app should not be in Generation Alpha.
