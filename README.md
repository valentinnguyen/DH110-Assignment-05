# DH110 Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
####_Valentin Nguyen | Spring 2021 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

My current project, _GenMeet_ (name is still tentative), seeks to bridge the gap between people of starkly different generations. The target community are people that are curious to meet other people during the pandemic, socialize within their place of residency, and like spending time with others. These people are looking to socialize and meet other people from different generations to get to know their culture and personalities from the comfort of their own home. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common limitations of chatting online:

1. **User Verification Check** - ensures that users go through a thorough virtual background check to establish a strong sense of safety between users
2. **Help Page** - provides a list of commonly asked questions in regards to the legitimacy of the app as well as how to navigate it.
3. **Overall Trustworthy & Aesthetic Design:** - creates a sense of safety for users when they use the app so that they know the chatting service is meant for serious, productive, and purposeful intentions rather than less serious intentions

**User Personas:** The main target users would specifically be milennials and baby boomers, but can also cater towards other generations as well. Users value ease of use as well as a desktop chatting user experience rather than a mobile chatting user experience. User personas were created based on older generations (Generation x and older) looking to find an easy and accessible way to meet others using technology: one introverted, adults librarian who wants to learn how to talk to people easily and casually, and one retired real estate agent who is interested in how younger people use social media, but does not know how to use it himself and seeks to find out.

**Purpose:** The puropse of this low-fidelty prototype is to test the functionality and flow of the features listed above, and to see how well it can be integrated into the current process of meeting other people.
